# Event Generator

 Utility for generating large amounts of dummy event objects for the jQuery fullCalendar plugin and my own event manager project, Foresight. Its primary use is for benchmarking Foresight, and the generator isn't very flexible at the moment (i.e., it pretty much only generates events according to Foresight's schema.)
